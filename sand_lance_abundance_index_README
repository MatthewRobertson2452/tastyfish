This csv contains model estimates for Northern sand lance on the Grand Bank of Newfoundland (NAFO divisions 3LNO) from 1996 - 2018. 
We recommend using the Both_index estimates since this model integrated all available data. 
However, we also provided model estimates from the single-species models for transparency.

Plaice_index is the estimates time-series for sand lance abundance from the model that combined trawl survey and American plaice stomach contents data.
Plaice_low95 is the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the Plaice_index
Plaice_high95 is the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for the Plaice_index

Cod_index is the estimates time-series for sand lance abundance from the model that combined trawl survey and Atlantic cod stomach contents data.
Cod_low95 is the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the Cod_index
Cod_high95 is the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for the Cod_index
